It prevents plants from abosrbing the moisture they need to grow and gain nourishment so the plants will look as though they are suffering from a lack of water, stress or lacking minerals despite the soil being ritch or continually wet.Specifically root rot is a fungus which thrives in wet soil.","All","Once root rot is detected the crop needs to be removed to prevent spreading of the fungi through the soil. The best mitigation strategy for root rot is prevention. It spreads through wet soil so the best practices are to ensure 1. The soil is kept as dry as possible 2. Let the soil dry before irrigation 3. Ensure drainage is effective throughout farm so that water can evaporate from soil and flow away when excess is present. Raised beds where the plant root is above the soil level is effective.","Before implementing chemical products, it is best to firstly identify the fungus that is causing the problem.

The solanaceae family, which includes potatoes, eggplant, capsicum, chilli and tomatoes. 2. Cucumbers, melons and pumpkins. 3.  Strawberries, peaches, bananas, grapes, passionfruit, pineapples, pawpaw.","Crop rotation is one of the oldest and most economical methods of controlling Root Knot. Practices such as removing the roots of each crop as soon as harvest is completed, followed by tilling the soil two to three times is very effective in reducing nematode levels. To kill nematodes in soil, heat small quantities of moist soil to 140Â°F in the oven or by solarization. Heating soil in the oven over a time period needed to bake a medium-sized potato placed in the center of the soil is sufficient to kill nematodes; however, this is only practical for small quantities of soil.","Because root-knot nematodes live in the soil, chemical control requires applications of large amounts of chemicals with specialized equipment. Fumigants (such as 1,3-dichloropropene, methyl bromide and dazomet) are commonly applied as pre-plant treatments to reduce nematode numbers, but they must thoroughly penetrate large soil volumes to be effective. Some fumigants volatilize very quickly, so treated soil must have a cover or tarp to maintain the fumigant in the soil long enough to be effective. The phasing out of methyl bromide (an efficient fumigant) has intensified the search for alternatives that can be used by farmers. In addition to broad-spectrum fumigants, nervous system toxins (including oxamyl and fenamiphos) have been shown to be extremely effective for controlling root-knot nematodes. These chemicals (carbamates and organophosphates) are extremely toxic to humans and other non-target organisms. Currently, these chemicals are the most economically feasible control method for root-knot nematodes. Because they are not toxic to plants, they are the only chemical options for established plants.",null,null,"https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/nematodes/pages/rootknotnematode.aspx"),

Tiny, light, yellow specks (1-2mm long) appear on the upper leafe blade, parallel to the secondary veins. These specks later develop into narrow, brown or dark green spots with a spindle shape. Theses lesions expand further parallel to the veins and form oblong rusty red streaks with water-soaked centres and yellow halos (4 to 12 mm in length). The centers of the streaks gradually turn gray brown to brown, a sign of necrosis. Along the leaf margins, they coalesce to form large, black or brown necrotic leisons surrounded by patches of yellow areas. The cracking of the leaves gives them a ragged appearance.","Banana","To prevent this disease, farmers need to avoid high moisture through good drainage. Use resistant varieties (note that this can negatively impact taste). Leave sufficient space between plants to ensure good ventilation. Clear fields and surroundings of weeds. Ensure a balanced nutrition of the trees. Use fertilizers high in potassium to minimise the infestation. Apply urea as nitrogen source to compromise fungal growth on the soil. Cut off infected leaves, then burn them outside of the plantation or bury them. Biological control wth bio-fungicides based on Trichoderma atrovride have the potential to hinder the disease and are being tested for possible field applications. Bordeaux spray applied on pruning sites can hinder the progagation of the disease on these plan parts.","Fungicides containing mancozeb, calixin or chlorothalonil can be applied as foliar sprays when disease is not widespread.

As spots become more numerous, entire leaves may yellow, wither and drop.","All","1. Keep the soil under the tree clean and rake up fallen fruit. 2. Use a thick layer of mulch to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will reduce weeds and prevent the disease pathogen from splashing back up onto the leaves. 3. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. Leaf spot among vegetables is most often introduced through infected seed or transplants. 4. Spraying with a baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present). Baking soda may burn some plant leaves. Spray only a few and then check for a reaction before applying applications every two weeks. 5. Apply sulfur sprays or copper-based fungicides weekly at first sign of disease to prevent its spread.

As the disease progresses, infected parts shrivel, leaves fall off and plants may die.","All","Milk-waker solutions seem to work as natural fungicide. Apply this solution to the leaves every second day. This household remedy works especially well with cucurbits (cucumber, zucchini, pumpkin) and berries. The types of powdery mildew differ according to the host, and this solution may not be effective for all types. If no improvement is observed, try garlic or sodium bicarbonate solutions. Some prevention methods include: Use resistant or tolerant varieties. Plant crops with sufficient spacing to allow for good ventilation. Monitor fields regularly to assess the incidence of a disease or pest. Remove infected leaves when the first spots appear. Do not touch healthy plants after touching infected plants. A thick layer of mulch can prevent the dispersal of spores from the soil up onto the leaves. In some cases, crop rotation with non-susecptible crops works. Fertilize with a balanced nutrient supply. Avoid extreme temperature changes. Plow the soil thoroughly after harvest to dig plant residues deep into the soil. Remove plant residues after harvest.","So far, it is difficult to recommend any particular chemical treatment.

Usually after a series of warm humid nights, a dense, white to grayish cottony layer develops beneath these spots. The fungus extracts nutrients from the plant and causes a stunting of growth. Fruits and other plant parts can also be affected. The defoliation and the dwarfing or killing of young shoots, flowers or fruits lead to stunted growth and poor yields. In contrast to powdery mildew, the coating appear exclusively on the underside of leaves and its growth is limited by the main veins. Moreover, it cannot be removed easily.","All","In mild cases, it is often better not to do anything and wait until the weather improves.

In cereal, leaves with mild deficiencies develop a green linear beading that progresses to interveinal chlorosis. In severe cases, the chlorosis progresses to the middle of the leaf and the small veins also become affected. Reddish or brown spots appear on the leaf blade. Later on, the development of necrotic areas in the highly chlorotic tissue gives the leaves a rugged and deformed aspect. Finally, the yellowing engulfs the whole leaf, eventually leading to premature death and early shedding. Root growth is inhibited, resulting in poor plant vigor.","All","Apply substances that contain magnesium such as algal limestone, dolomite or limestone magnesium. Use manure, organic mulches or compost to balance the soil nutrient content. They contain organic matter and many nutrients that are released slowly into the soil.","Use soil or foliar fertilizers containing a magnesium complement. Magnesium oxide allows a slow release of the nutrient and is used in blends for an immediate supply of magnesium to crops.

The parasitoid wasps Encarsia formosa, Eretmocerus eremicus, the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea or beetles like Delphastus spp. are also commonly used. Other natural antagonists are predatory mites, nematodes, green lacewings, ladybirds, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs and damsel bugs. Pathogenic fungi include Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea, Verticillium lecanii and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus.","Whiteflies quickly develops resistance to all pesticides, so a rotation of different products is recommendable. Apply products based on or combinations of: bifenthrin, buprofezin, fenoxycarb, deltamethrin, azadirachtin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, pyrethroids pymetrozine or spiromesifen to control the insect. Be aware that preventive measures are often enough to reduce the population to harmless level.","Perform intercropping practices with non-susceptible plants. Use companion crops that attract or deter whiteflies (nasturtiums, zinnias, hummingbird bush, pineapple sage, bee balm). Consult with your neighbors and make sure to sow at the right time, not too early nor too late. Use denser plant space at planting. Watch for signs of whitefly on new purchases or transplants. Ensure a balanced plant fertilization. Do not use broad-spectrum insecticides that can affect beneficial insects. Remove leaves with eggs or larvae on them. At early stages of infection, place sticky traps in the fields to mass-catch whiteflies. Control weeds and alternate hosts in and around the field.

Contrary to other nutrients, the symptoms of this deficiency are generally not very striking and can be difficult to identify. In mild cases, a possible indication for this disorder is that plants are dwarfed or stunted. However, no obvious symptoms are observed on leaves. In severe deficiencies, stem and petioles show a dark green to purple discoloration. The lower sides of older leaves also show a purple pigmentation, starting on the tips and margins and later expanding to the rest of the lamina. These leaves may become leathery and veins may form a brown netting. In some cases, phosphorus deficiency is characterized by burnt tips and the development of chlorosis as well as necrotic patches on the leaf margins. Flowers and fruits are produced, but fruit yields are low.","All","Phosphorus levels in soils can be replenished by applying farmyard manure, or other materials (organic mulch, compost and guano) or a combination thereof. The incorporation of residues to the soil after harvest can also contribute to maintaining a positive phosphorus balance in the long term and improve soil structure. The decomposition of organic matter provides a steady supply of plant-available phosphorus.","Amendments are inexpensive and varied, and they can be easily applied to alleviate deficiency problems. Phosphorus is applied to plants in the form of phosphate together with nitrogen and potassium (the N-P-K trio in fertilizer products). Soil testing is recommended to determine the ratio of each of these nutrients. It varies depending on the type of soil, the plant variety in question and the concentration of nitrogen in soil. Usually, it is recommended to apply phosphorus and potassium a few weeks before sowing or planting. Nitrogen, in turn, should be applied in split applications later during vegetative growth.","Use varieties that are efficient at mining phosphorus from the soil.

New leaves are often smaller and narrower and have wavy margins. Over time, the chlorotic spots can turn a bronze color and necrotic spots may start to develop from the margins. In some crops, zinc-deficient leaves often have shortened internodes, so leaves are clustered on the stem (rosetting). Leaf deformation and reduced growth may occur, caused by restricted development of new leaves (dwarf leaves) and reduced internode length.","All","Application of organic manure to the seedbed, or to the field a few days after transplanting reduces the odds of observing zinc deficiency.","Products containing ZnSO4 (2g/l of water) can be spread in the nursery seedbed to prevent deficiencies. Apply foliar sprays of Zinc Sulphate 0.2-0.5 % at weekly intervals or every 10 days (3 sprays) after noticing symptoms.
